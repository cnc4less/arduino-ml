# Simple Linear Regression

This project is an implementation of a simple linear regression algorithm. The simple linear regression algorithm has only one independent variable and one dependent variable. The algorithm is build from scratch in Python and C.

## Problem

We want to build an AIoT device that can predict the number of bike-sharing users using temperature as the independent variable. We want to use real-time temperature value from sensor as input to our simple linear regression algorithm. We want to build a GUI for this system.

## Solution

1. Build the model in Python
   - Prepare data set
   - Build model
   - Train model with gradient descent
2. Build the model in C Arduino
3. Deploy the model in ESP32
